# Conclusion

Our group started with the intention to look at social determinants of health and how that affects public health outcomes in the United States. By creating powerful data visualizations we displayed some of the factors that put communities at risk and have started work to convince those who read our research that these considerations are important. We have worked to answer some of the inquiries from our initial intentions, but like any data science path, there are more questions that have come up in our research, and these questions can't be answered by merely one data set.

# Implications
Our research has the power to bring attention to under-served counties and households. Overall, our research in this field has great implications for resource allocation, government policy, and even the cycle of poverty through the lens of public health. By estimating the needs of a population, public health authorities can be better prepared and at-risk populations can be supplied aid more efficiently. The health and well-being of communities in the United States should be a top priority at local, state, and national levels of governance.
