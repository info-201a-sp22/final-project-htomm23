# **Social Vulnerability in the United States**

Recently, social vulnerability has been at the forefront in the world of public health. As the global pandemic situation getting repeatably worse, we are motivated to find the reasons why some of the communities were less affected while the overall country was facing the same issue. Knowing the characteristics of these communities allows us to help vulnerable communities improve their population health.

## What is "SVI" ?
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has created the *Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)* which indicates the relative vulnerability of communities, pulling data from the U.S. Census, in order to help public health officials to identify the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event. An SVI value takes into account factors such as poverty, access to transportation and housing, as well as income, and consolidates it into a number. **The higher the SVI value, the more "at risk" a community may be. Oppositely, the lower the SVI value, the less "at risk" a community is.**

## About The Dataset
Through networks of health statistics and data collection, we found [this dataset](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html) with 120 columns (variables) corresponding to 3142 observations (rows) corresponding to United States' counties. This data was collected from US Census data and variables were ranked and somewhat weighted to help gauge the social vulnerability of each household. This data is taken only for the year 2018 and it addresses the US population as a whole. Though, the scope is still relatively easy to digest as these observations represent tangible areas rather than household identification numbers (as usually collected in the Census). The data we chose was collected by the CDC with the purpose of being able to identify potential communities most at risk for a hazardous events and in which ways they will need help from public health officials.

## *Explore this Site*
Our group is using the CDC's SVI database to help us understand the trends in social vulnerability. We ask,

1)

2)

3) How is social vulnerability distributed geographically? How can policy be directed at key areas of vulnerability so that these places in need are addressed?
